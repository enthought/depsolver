Todo

A list of things for a first 0.1 release + public announcement:

    - Add support for multiple candidates coming out from policy
    - Think about a decent API for Policy
    - Fix rule set generator:

        - add provides support in install rule
        - move to a OO design

    - Add Job concept (install / remove / update)
    - Asbtract rule/variables
    - Extract id from package (id should be conceptually tied to a repository,
      to allow things like repository priorities)
    - Add at least a tutorial-like to the doc

Ideally, it should support everything needed to update EPD from last release to
newest repo.
